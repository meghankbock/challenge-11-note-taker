# challenge-11-note-taker

## Summary
This repository contains the HTML and Javascript code for the Note Taker application. This application utilizes Node.js and Express.js to create a front- and back-end application that 1) captures user input to create notes (including title and description), 2) renders the notes in the client-side web browser, and 3) saves the notes to a server-side JSON database. In addition to creating notes, the user has the ability to delete notes, which removes it from the UI and deletes it from the database.
