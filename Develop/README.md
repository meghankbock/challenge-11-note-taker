# challenge-11-note-taker

## Summary
This repository contains the HTML and Javascript code for the Note Taker application. This application utilizes Node.js and Express.js to create a front- and back-end application that captures user input to create a note (including note title and note description), renders the note in the client-side web browser, and saves the note to a server-side JSON database.
